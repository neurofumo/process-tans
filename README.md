# Process-tans
**This script only works for Windows!** Detailed docs coming soon...

## Folder map:
- [process] contains json data about the processes.
- [process/imgs] contains images.

## Note:
When clicking random unknown processes, the script generates image files with the process name.
I plan to not make these image files useless when I know how to get the icons from processes.
